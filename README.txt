# 1. Installation
Copy newTemplate_en.app to a folder. It could be Applications folder, or a folder named Scripts that you use to store script files.

Just drag it into the Finder Toolbar to have it always handy, and so it will work properly (till future versions). So when the directory you want to copy the new template to is open in Finder, you just have to click newTemplate icon in the toolbar. 

On launch newTemplate checks if a folder named Templates exists in your Home folder. If it doesn't exist, ask for permission to create it, and also it will add an example template: an empty txt, to create an empty text file quickly without opening a text editor.

# 2. Use
Open the folder where you want to create the file in Finder and click newTemplate icon in Finder Toolbar.

All templates you copy to Templates folder will appear in the list when you launch newTemplate.

A template is just an empty or almost empty file that it's copied to the folder where we launched newTemplate.

You can create templates, for example, a html file with your default headers, a markdown file with the structure of your blog articles, a python script with your info and external libraries imported, etc

# 4. Roadmap

I don't have a defined roadmap. This is just a little script. I'll keep adding little improvements and additional checkings.

Some ideas I want to implement:
   • possibility to launch newTemplate as a standalone app, giving choice to select destination folder
   • select multiples templates to copy
   • keep looking into the way to let user to config some default vars such as folder name Templates. I still haven't found a solution or a workaround without adding external apps in other languages.
   • I want to finish developing a templateManager to manage your templates and add new ones. I think I'm asking too much to applescript.
